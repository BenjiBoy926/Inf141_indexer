INF 141 SEARCH ENGINE

Run the file "query.py" with a python command using the terminal using:

-- python3 <query.py dir>

where <query.py dir> is the path to the "query.py" file

You may, if you desire, pass additional parameters to the shell command after <query.py dir>

-- python3 <query.py dir> <query1> <query2> ... <queryN>

The search engine will automatically search each term that you pass in as a shell parameter when the engine starts
(NOTE: remember that if you want to input a multi-word query from the command line,
surround the query in "double quotes")

Once the program finishes running the parameters received form the command line,
you will be prompted to enter the terms for your search:

-- Enter the terms to search for (type 'x' to exit):

From here, simply enter the terms you want to search for and hit "Enter"!
